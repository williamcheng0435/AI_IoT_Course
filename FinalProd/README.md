# DetectTensorFlow Lite Python object detection hosted by Flask example with Raspberry Pi

The project's detection algorithm originated from [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite) with Python on
a Raspberry Pi to perform real-time object detection using images streamed from
the Pi Camera. It draws a bounding box around each detected object in the camera
preview (when the object score is above a given threshold).
